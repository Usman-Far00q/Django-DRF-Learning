# ERD of Project:

```
(please note that in the pic above the cardinality of
the relation between **Artist** <--> **Album**
should have been **one-to-many** {even in
the case of albums having collabs from multiple
artists, the album belongs to only ONE of them}, but
instead of **one-to-many**, I made the cardinality
be **one-to-one** simply because I could not
find an example that fit the context of
this project AND had one-to-one cardinality)
