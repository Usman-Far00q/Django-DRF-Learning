# ERD of Project:

![A Pic of ERD of the Project](https://github.com/Usman-Far00q/Django-DRF-Learning/blob/main/ERD%20Diagram%20For%20Django_Project_1.png?raw=true)

> **Note:** In the pic above the cardinality of the relation between **Artist** <--> **Album** should have been **one-to-many** {even in the case of albums having collabs from multiple
artists, the album belongs to only ONE of them}, but instead of **one-to-many**, I made the cardinality be **one-to-one** simply because I could not find an example that fit/fitted the context of this project AND had one-to-one cardinality)
